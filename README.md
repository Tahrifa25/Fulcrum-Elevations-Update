# Fulcrum-Elevations-Update
A local script in python for Joint Use that makes API calls out to Fulcrum, grabs coordinates of poles filled in within a certain amount of time, makes calls to public API USGS, gets elevation and updates the elevation back to Fulcrum. Final version will have Azure functions and will be set to run once a week.
